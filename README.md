# AI Client Experiment

This project is an experiment designed to explore and learn about the following main goals:

- **How does Ollama work?**
- **How do various models handle various tasks?**
- **Using AI to generate all the code ("vibe coding")**
- **How do AIs use tools, and what are the mechanisms to provide tools?**

---

## Vibe Coding

> **95% of the code in this project was generated by AI.**

To understand the capabilities of AI code generation, this project follows a strict process:

1. **Ask the AI** to add or modify a feature.
2. **Copy the generated code** directly into the editor.
3. **Run the code.**
4. **Repeat** from the top.

---

## Observations

- The AI is good at writing lots of boilerplate that is otherwise a pain to write.
- The AI is good at knowing obscure language and library features that would otherwise take a long time to learn or discover.
